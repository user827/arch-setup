# when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:

# long keyids are more collision-resistant than short keyids (it's trivial to make a key with any desired short keyid)

# when multiple digests are supported by all recipients, choose the strongest one:
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
# preferences chosen for new keys should prioritize stronger algorithms:

# when making an OpenPGP certification, use a stronger digest than the default SHA1:

# When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
# certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.
# This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
